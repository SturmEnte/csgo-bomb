# CSGO Bomb

## How does it work?

1. Enter a password that can later be used to defuse the bomb
2. After that is the bomb in the running mode. The bomb will detonate after 60 seconds. You can stop that by entering the before set password
3. The bomb will display "defused" when the entered password is correct or "detonated" when the entered password was wrong or the timer ran out

## Controls

When entering a password (Either for starting or defusing) you can clear the input with the * key and enter it with the # key

The "A-B-C-D" row is not connected because it does not get used
